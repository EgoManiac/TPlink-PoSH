# TPlink-PoSH
A Powershell Implmentation of TP-Link hs110 control software

Welcome to the powershell implmentation of TP-Link HS110/HS100 plugs. 

The project was started as i needed a scripted method for controling the TP-Link plugs that didn't involve any other programing language.
The Work is an offshoot from a Pyton PoC by Lubomir Stroetmann, Consultant and Tobias Esser, Consultant and their great work can be found
at https://www.softscheck.com/en/reverse-engineering-tp-link-hs110/

The program is very rough and ready, but hopefully provides a basis for someone to pick u and run with. 
I am thinking Scheduled tasks at an office - Energy Recording to an online energy dashboard.

Have Fun, and feel free to drop me a message if you need help, or use the code to do something cool.

Chris
